  ### Creating and Activating a New Environment with the Latest Python Version

  1. Open a terminal (or Command Prompt on Windows).
  2. Create a new conda environment with the latest Python version:
      ```sh
      conda create --name myenv python=3.10
      ```
      Replace `myenv` with your desired environment name.

  3. Activate the newly created environment:
      ```sh
      conda activate myenv
      ```

  ### Installing Requirements

  <details>
    <summary>macOS/Unix</summary>

    1. With the environment activated, install the requirements from `macosrequirements.txt`:
        ```sh
        conda install --file path/to/macosrequirements.txt
        ```

  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Windows</summary>

    1. With the environment activated, install the requirements from `requirements.txt`:
        ```sh
        conda install --file path/to/requirements.txt
        ```

  </details>

  ### Summary of Commands

  <details>
    <summary>For macOS/Unix</summary>

    ```sh
    # Install Miniconda
    bash Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh  # or bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
    conda init

    # Create and activate a new environment
    conda create --name myenv python=3.10
    conda activate myenv

    # Install requirements
