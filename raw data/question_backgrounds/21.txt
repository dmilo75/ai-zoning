Remember to first review your research so far on how a lot size is calculated and defined. If you have already found a restriction on including wetlands, sloped land, or easements in your prior research then the answer is 'YES'.

Some municipalities require that the minimum lot size requirement be met by a percentage of land that does not include wetland resource areas, steeply sloped land or easements. A subset of those municipalities requires that the buildable area be contiguous on the lot – called “contiguous buildable area” or “contiguous upland area.” Upland area is non-wetland area. It is much more common for municipalities to restrict the use of wetlands areas in meeting lot size requirements than sloped land or easements.

Note that this question only asks about whether there are restrictions on calculating the lot size. It does not ask about whether there are restrictions to buildable area or whether there are any restrictions in wetland areas. 

If you do not find any restrictions for lot size calculations in the context then you assume that the answer is 'NO'.
