When answering this question, examine the zoning ordinances and bylaws for any townwide requirements that mandate public hearings or formal public input processes for multi-family residential developments. Focus on requirements that apply across all zones within the town. Answer YES if public hearings are required for any subset of multi-family projects, even if not all multi-family projects require hearings. For instance, if larger projects require public hearings while smaller ones don't, the answer should still be YES. Requirements specific to certain zones do not count towards a YES answer. Answer NO only if there are no townwide public hearing requirements for multi-family developments of any size or type, or if such requirements only apply in specific zones. Be sure to cite relevant ordinance sections that support your conclusion. The goal is to determine whether there is any mandated opportunity for public input on new multi-family housing developments on a townwide basis, even if this only applies to certain categories of multi-family projects.
