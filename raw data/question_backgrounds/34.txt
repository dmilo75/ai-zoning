The review process for constructing a new multi-family building involves several stages, each of which may have a specific waiting period. The total waiting time includes the mandatory review periods as well as any discretionary days that can be added by the governing bodies or agencies. Each agency or department that a developer must interact with, such as city government departments like fire, police, sanitation, building, and planning, has its own review timeline. Additionally, discretionary days that may be required for public hearings, environmental reviews, or other procedural requirements must also be added to the total count of government review days.
