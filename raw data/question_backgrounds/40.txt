This question seeks to determine the number of parking spots required for a residential unit that is at least 1000 square feet in size within the jurisdiction. Such units are typically two-bedroom apartments or larger. When reviewing zoning regulations, look for off-street parking requirements for multi-family or apartment developments, paying attention to any size-specific or bedroom-count-based requirements. If the requirements vary based on unit size or number of bedrooms, assume a two-bedroom unit for a 1000 SF apartment. If requirements differ by zone, report the most common requirement or the requirement for the zone with the most multi-family housing. For variable requirements, use the minimum number required for a two-bedroom unit. If the ordinance uses ranges, report the minimum required. In cases where no specific requirement is found for units of this size or apartments in general, report 0. If the requirement is expressed as a ratio (e.g., spots per bedroom or per unit), calculate the exact number for a typical two-bedroom unit, even if it results in a fraction. Do not round the result. Your final answer should be a numerical value, which can include fractions or decimals, representing the precise number of required parking spots for a unit of at least 1000 square feet as stated in the ordinance.
