The development of multifamily housing through the conversion of existing buildings encompasses two primary approaches: transforming single-family or two-family houses into structures with at least three units, and repurposing non-residential buildings, such as mills, other industrial buildings, schools, and municipal buildings, for multi-family residential use. This is different from the ability to construct new multi-family housing. The conversion of non-residential structures often occurs through designated overlay districts, like Mill Conversion Overlay Districts, or within industrial zones, whereas the conversion of houses to accommodate more units typically takes place in residential or business districts. The question does not count the conversion of single-family homes into two-family dwellings as allowing conversion to multi-family dwellings because multi-family is defined as having at least three units. If the conversion requires a special permit then we consider that as allowing conversion.  Assisted living facilities, congregate care homes, dormitories, and lodging houses are not considered multi-family housing. The allowance of multi-family housing does not imply the allowance of the conversion to multi-family housing. You must search for an explicit statement allowing the conversion to multi-family housing from another type of structure. If you do not find any mention of conversions in the context then you assume the answer is 'NO'.
