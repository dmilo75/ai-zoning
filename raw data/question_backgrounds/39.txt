This question aims to determine the number of parking spots required for a residential unit that is 600 square feet or smaller in the jurisdiction. Such units are typically studio or small one-bedroom apartments. When reviewing zoning regulations, look for off-street parking requirements specifically for small units, efficiency apartments, or studios. If size-specific requirements don't exist, use the general requirement for multi-family or apartment developments. Check for any reductions or exemptions for small units or units near transit. If requirements vary by zone, report the most common requirement or the requirement for the zone with the most small units. For variable requirements (e.g., based on number of bedrooms), assume a studio or one-bedroom configuration. If the ordinance uses ranges, report the minimum required. In cases where no specific requirement is found for small units or apartments in general, report 0. If the requirement is expressed as a ratio (e.g., spots per unit or per bedroom), calculate the exact number for the assumed unit type, even if it results in a fraction. Do not round the result. Your final answer should be a numerical value, which can include fractions or decimals, representing the precise number of required parking spots for a unit of 600 square feet or less as stated in the ordinance.
