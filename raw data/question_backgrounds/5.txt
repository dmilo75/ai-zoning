Zoning bylaws and ordinances in various municipalities often contain provisions for combining residential dwellings with commercial uses such as retail or office spaces, creating mixed-use developments. While some zoning regulations explicitly allow multi-family housing and retail to coexist within the same district, they may not clarify whether these uses can share the same building, leaving this to be determined in practice. Certain municipalities explicitly permit "combined dwelling/retail" configurations in their use regulation tables, sometimes noting that any uses allowed within the same district can occupy the same building. Additionally, detailed provisions for mixed-use are facilitated through special zoning arrangements like overlay districts (e.g., mixed use district, downtown overlay, or planned unit development) or conversion projects, such as transforming former mills to accommodate both retail and housing. However, it's important to note that some references to "mixed use" may actually pertain to commercial and industrial combinations, excluding residential components. If you cannot find any reference to residential and commercial uses in the same building within the context then you assume that the answer is 'NO'.
