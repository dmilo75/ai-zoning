The question asks whether some form of attached housing is allowed in the municipality. Common forms of attached housing are single-family attached homes, townhouses, rowhouses, and zero lot line dwelling units. Attached housing is often allowed through special zoning provisions, such as overlay districts or use provisions tailored for cluster developments, Planned Unit Developments (PUD), or communities for active adults aged 55 and over. Remember that accessory apartments to a single-family home or the ability to attach one unit to a single-family home do not count as attached housing. Duplexes also do not count as attached housing. A form of attached housing may be listed as a type of single-family or multi-family housing. However, the allowance of single-family or multi-family housing does not imply the allowance of attached housing. This context raises the question of whether any type of attached housing are allowed either as their own category of housing or explicitly as a type of single family or multi-family housing. If you do not find any mention of a type of attached housing in the context then you assume that the answer is 'NO'.
