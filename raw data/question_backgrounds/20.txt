Some municipalities enact town-wide caps limiting the number of units that can come on line annually or biannually. The number of permits is often set at the average in the previous years. Note that this question asks only about town-wide caps and does not consider caps exclusive to a specific district in the town. Some municipalities require phased growth for individual developments (also known as development scheduling or buildout scheduling) - a technique that allows for the gradual buildout of approved subdivisions over a number of years. Note that we only consider project phasing when it is required and not when it is optional. Project phasing is usually triggered by a minimum number of units in the project, so small subdivisions can be constructed in one year. Some phasing provisions are only triggered at the town-wide level once a threshold number of units have been permitted. Most of the “rate of development” provisions include an expiration or “sun set” date (some that have expired have been updated and re-adopted). Many include a “point system” where points are awarded for provision of community goods such as open space or affordable units, and projects with more points are given priority for permits. If you do not find any information in the context about a town-wide annual or biannual cap or about project phasing then you assume the answer is 'NO'.
