This question seeks to determine if the jurisdiction has any mandatory minimum parking requirements in any area or for any type of development. A "parking minimum" is a regulation requiring a specific number of parking spaces based on factors like size, use, or occupancy of a building or development. When reviewing zoning regulations, look for off-street parking requirements in all districts and for all uses (residential, commercial, industrial, etc.), expressed as ratios or fixed numbers. Answer "Yes" if there are parking minimums in any zoning district or for any specific use, even if other areas have no minimums or have maximum parking limits. Flexible standards count if they establish a baseline requirement. Don't count purely advisory guidelines, but consider language like "shall" or "must provide" as indicative of a requirement. In ambiguous cases, err towards "Yes" if there's any indication of a mandatory minimum parking requirement.
