When answering this question, focus on whether the zoning ordinances or bylaws explicitly mandate approval from any local government body for typical new multi-family building projects. Look for language that specifically requires such approval, even for projects that comply with existing zoning regulations. Identify which local government bodies (e.g., planning board, zoning board, city council) are involved in the approval process for multi-family developments. Consider whether different types or scales of multi-family projects have different approval requirements. Pay attention to any mandatory review processes, such as site plan reviews or special permit requirements, that inherently involve approval from a local government body. Distinguish between required approvals and advisory reviews or recommendations. Cite relevant sections of the ordinances that support your conclusion, explaining how they apply to typical multi-family projects. If multiple bodies are involved, clarify which ones have final approval authority versus those playing advisory roles.
