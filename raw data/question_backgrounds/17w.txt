Zoning codes may require developers to include affordable housing in market-rate residential projects, but the applicability of these requirements can vary. Some inclusionary policies apply broadly to all residential development, while others are tied to optional zoning designations, incentive programs, or specific areas.

To determine if a zoning code contains a mandatory inclusionary requirement, look for clear language stating that all or most market-rate residential projects must provide affordable units as a standard condition of approval under normal zoning rules. The requirement should not be limited to projects that opt into a special zoning designation, participate in an incentive program, or are located in a particular overlay zone.

Focus on whether the code unambiguously requires all or most market-rate residential development to include affordable housing under the generally applicable rules. Do not select "YES" if affordable housing is only mandatory in narrow, specialized situations. The mere presence of affordable housing provisions is not sufficient if they are elective or only apply in atypical circumstances. If the affordable housing requirements are not clearly universally applicable, the likely answer is "NO".
