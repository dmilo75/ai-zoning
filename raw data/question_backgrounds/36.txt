This question aims to determine if the jurisdiction mandates any form of covered parking, including garages or carports, for new single-family detached houses. A "yes" answer applies if any residential zones require covered parking spaces, even if not explicitly called "garages." Look for requirements in all relevant residential districts, considering both by-right and special permit scenarios. Requirements may vary by district or lot size. Mandatory covered parking spaces, carports, or similar structures should be interpreted as equivalent to garage requirements. Only answer "no" if there are no clear requirements for any form of covered parking across all relevant residential zones for single-family detached homes. Incentives without mandates do not constitute a requirement. If in doubt, err on the side of answering "yes" if there's any indication of mandatory covered parking.
