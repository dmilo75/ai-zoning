When answering this question, focus on the approval process for a typical new multi-family building project as described in the provided ordinance sections. Only count distinct governing bodies or agencies whose approval is explicitly required by the ordinances for all multi-family building projects, including those allowed "by right" under existing zoning.
To be counted, an entity must have clear, independent approval authority that is mandatory for the project to proceed. This approval must be specifically for the multi-family project itself. Look for unambiguous language indicating required, independent approval steps. Distinguish between actual approval authority and advisory roles; entities that only review or provide input should not be counted.
Consider roles like the Planning Board, Board of Health, Building Commissioner, and special permit granting authorities, but include them only if their approval is explicitly required and independent. For coordinated review processes, determine whether they represent multiple independent approvals or a single approval incorporating multiple inputs.
Provide your answer as a number, followed by a brief explanation of which entities you counted and why. Cite relevant ordinance sections, explaining why each approval is considered independent and mandatory, and how it relates specifically to the multi-family project.
