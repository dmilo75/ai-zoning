This question seeks to determine the number of parking spots required for a typical single-family residential lot in the jurisdiction. A "single family lot" refers to a parcel intended for one detached dwelling unit. When reviewing zoning regulations, look for off-street parking requirements in residential districts that allow single-family homes. These requirements may be expressed as a fixed number or as a ratio (e.g., spots per bedroom). Include both enclosed (garage) and unenclosed (driveway) spaces in your count if the ordinance doesn't distinguish between them. If requirements vary by zone, report the most common requirement or the requirement for the largest single-family residential zone. For variable requirements (e.g., based on home size or bedrooms), assume a typical 3-bedroom home. If the ordinance uses ranges or minimums and maximums, report the minimum required. In cases where no specific requirement is stated for single-family homes, but a general residential requirement exists, use that figure. If no requirement is found, report 0. Your final answer should be a single numerical value representing the number of required parking spots.
