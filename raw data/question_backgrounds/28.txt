When compiling a list of minimum lot sizes for districts that permit single-family housing, prioritize clarity by selecting the specific minimum lot size for single-family homes within each district. If multiple options exist, choose the most common standard size, excluding sizes for historic properties or special cases. Report sizes in square feet over acres unless only acre measurements are available. Only include districts with a defined minimum lot size or those adhering to a town-wide minimum if no district-specific size is established. Finalize the data in a CSV format with columns for 'District Name', 'Min Lot Size', 'Unit', and 'Estate', ensuring a straightforward, single entry for each district that reflects the standard requirement for single-family homes.
