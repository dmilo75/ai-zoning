Many zoning bylaws/ordinances include provisions for housing that is deed restricted to occupants 55 (or another age) and older. Some of the provisions are for developments that are entirely age-restricted, while other provisions are incentives, often density bonuses, to include age-restricted units within an unrestricted development, such as cluster or multi-family. The restricted developments are called active adult housing, adult retirement village, senior village, planned retirement community, or something similar.

The answer should be Yes if any provisions exist for age-restricted single-family, townhouse, duplex, multi-family or accessory apartments. Provisions can be in the form of an age-restricted overlay, cluster development, density bonus for age-restricted units, or other zoning requirements or incentives for age-restricted housing.
