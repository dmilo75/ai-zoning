Flexible zoning, encompassing terms like open space residential design, cluster, planned unit development, or conservation subdivision, provides municipalities with a more adaptable approach to zoning beyond the traditional “as-of-right” options. This methodology allows developers to bypass the stringent requirements of standard zoning, such as specific lot sizes and setback mandates, and enables the incorporation of various residential unit types like townhouses, duplexes, and multi-family homes that might not be allowed under conventional zoning regulations. The question only considers provisions that are primarily for residential uses. Most municipalities require special permits for cluster/flexible development so if you find suggestive evidence that the municipality allows cluster/flexible development by special permit then you assume that the answer is 'YES'.
