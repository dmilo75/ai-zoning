The question asks to provide a list of the minimum lot size in each district of the town. If a district has different minimum lot sizes depending on the type of building like for example a different minimum lot size for single-family homes than for multi-family homes, then you pick the smaller of the minimum lot sizes. If a district allows smaller minimum lot sizes for historic properties or by special permission then you pick the standard minimum lot size for current buildings. If a district only lists a minimum lot size for a specific type of housing like housing for the elderly, then you pick that minimum lot size. Your answer should be structured as a list with district name, minimum lot size, and units for the minimum lot size which are usually square feet or acres. If a minimum lot size for a district is reported in both acres and square feet then only report it in square feet. If a district does not have a minimum lot size then record the town wide minimum lot size for that district if a town wide minimum lot size exists. If a town wide minimum lot size does not exist and a district does not have a minimum lot size then exclude it from your answer.
