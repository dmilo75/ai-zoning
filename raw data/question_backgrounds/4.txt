Multi-family housing comes in a wide variety of forms and sizes. The ways municipalities define and categorize “multi-family” housing varies widely, as do the use-regulations that govern multi-family housing development. This study includes as “multi-family” any building with three or more dwelling units. Multi-family dwelling units can be rental or condominium. They can be in a freestanding residential building or part of a mixed-use building, new construction or conversion of a preexisting building. Zoning documents usually specify what kinds of buildings qualify for conversion to multi-family housing: single family houses, two family houses, mills, schools, churches, municipal buildings or other types of facilities. Freestanding new "Multi-family" housing is defined as any building with three or more dwelling units, excluding townhouses, unless a municipality includes townhouses in its broader definition of multi-family housing and effectively permits only townhouses as such. Assisted living facilities, congregate care homes, dormitories, and lodging houses are not considered multi-family housing. If the zoning laws allow for conversion to multi-family housing, but do not comment on whether new multi-family housing is allowed, then the answer is 'YES'. Most towns allow a form of multi-family housing.
