Inclusionary zoning requires or encourages developers to include affordable dwelling units within new developments of market rate homes. Some municipalities call it “incentive zoning” - when provision of affordable units is voluntary. The affordable units are typically located on site, but some municipalities also allow off-site development under certain circumstances. Often, payments may be made to a trust fund in lieu of building housing. Housing designated as “affordable” must be restricted by deed or covenant, usually for a period of 30 or more years, to residents with low or moderate incomes. The deed restrictions also limit sales prices and rents as the units are vacated, sold or leased to new tenants. 

Do not include provisions for entirely affordable, subsidized housing development by public or non-profit corporations. Also do not include provisions under “rate of development” headings that exempt affordable units from project phasing and growth caps.
