Accessory dwellings are separate housing units typically created in surplus or specially added space in owner-occupied single-family homes. Accessory dwellings can also be attached to the primary dwelling or be situated on the same lot (for example in a carriage house or small cottage.) An accessory dwelling typically has its own kitchen and bathroom facilities, not shared with the principal residence. Many zoning bylaws/ordinances call the dwellings “in-law apartments” or “family apartments” and restrict their occupancy to relatives of the homeowner - “related by blood, marriage or adoption.” Some of these also allow domestic employees, caregivers, elderly people or people with low incomes to live in the units. Some municipalities allow the apartment by right if a family member will occupy the accessory apartment, but require a special permit otherwise. If you cannot find any reference to accessory apartments in the context then you assume that the answer is 'NO'.
