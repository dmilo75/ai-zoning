The approval process for constructing a new multi-family building typically involves multiple mandatory steps, each representing a distinct interaction or requirement that a developer must fulfill before construction can begin. Focus on identifying only the core, pre-construction approval steps that are required for all multi-family building projects, from initial application submission to final permit issuance. Each required interaction with a distinct city department or agency should be counted as a separate step, but be careful not to artificially separate closely related actions within a single process. For example, applying for and obtaining a building permit should be considered one step, not two. Be cautious not to include optional or discretionary steps, post-approval activities such as inspections during construction or certificate of occupancy issuance, steps that are only required in specific circumstances or for certain types of properties, or internal processes within departments that don't require direct developer interaction. When analyzing the ordinances, pay close attention to language indicating whether a step is mandatory (e.g., "shall", "must", "is required") versus optional or conditional (e.g., "may", "at the discretion of", "if applicable"). The goal is to identify the minimum number of distinct, mandatory steps that every multi-family building project must go through in the approval process, avoiding redundancy and over-segmentation of closely related actions.
